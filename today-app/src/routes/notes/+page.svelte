	<h3>NOTES</h3>
	<p>
		The cool thing about notes, is that they'll kind of just sort themselves out. That is, you can
		fiddle with choosing a goal, and tagging, and dating, and all those mucky details... or you can
		just let the note's figure it all out on their own.
	</p>
	<p>
		When you create a note, AI will read it and compare it to your list of goals, and your previous
		notes. If your note fits with an existing goal, the AI will sort it for you. If the AI notices a
		bunch of notes related to a Goal that doesn't exist (but probably should), the AI will create
		the Goal and attach all your relevant notes.
